# View and Vote Polling
A basic poll application built with Django and Python to explore and learn Django.

The app is composed of two parts:
1. A public site that allows users to view polls and vote in them
2. An admin site that allows for adding, changing and deleting polls.

The project is built within a virtual environment.



## Day 1: Project Setup
* Set up a repo
* Added gitignore
* Created a virtual env
* Created a project called polling
* Verified Django project works by checking the development server online
* Created app called polls

## Day 2: First View
* Made an index view and wired it into the URLconf. Verified it works with `python manage.py runserver`, and navigated, via the URL, to /polls/.
