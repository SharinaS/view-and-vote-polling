# View and Vote Polling
A basic poll application built with Django and Python to explore and learn Django.

The app is composed of two parts:
1. A public site that allows users to view polls and vote in them
2. An admin site that allows for adding, changing and deleting polls.

The project is built within a virtual environment.
